Multipass:  Run your command on a group of servers simultaneously.  

Usage:  multipass.rb [options] user_name server_file.csv 'command' 
 
If the p flag is specified, multipass will prompt for a second
password to be used if the command that is run requires one. For
example: 'multipass -p username serverlist.csv 'sudo passwd'
would first prompt the user 'username' for his administrative password
then it would prompt for a second password twice to verify that it is
correct, which will be passed to the shell when the 'passwd' command
executes.

user_name:        the short-name you use to administer the servers

server_file.csv:  a list servers (resolvable FQDNs or IP's) in a comma
                  separated variable (CSV) file.  As of this version,
                  the file may only contain IPs or FQDNs each in a
                  separate cell.

'command' :       command to be run on the servers.
THE COMMAND MUST BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES, AS ABOVE
